Deprecated UI (Do Not Use)

The pages and scripts in this folder implemented an earlier demo UI and are now considered legacy.

Status:
- Deprecated: not used by the development workflow or debug scripts.
- Kept only as a reference for future feature parity work in the main Simulate-like UI.
- The Playwright probe now targets the main entry at /index.html.

Note: The snapshots.mjs helper is a small utility sometimes imported by the main viewer for temporary diagnostics. It is not a UI surface and can remain until fully migrated.
